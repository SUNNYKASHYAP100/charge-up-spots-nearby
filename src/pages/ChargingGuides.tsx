                      For optimal battery health, keep your EV's charge level between 20% and 80% most of the time.
                      Only charge to 100% when you need the full range for a specific trip.

                      For long journeys, plan your charging stops in advance. Add 20-30% buffer to your range estimates 
                      to account for weather conditions, elevation changes, and unexpected detours.

                      question: "How long does it take to charge an electric vehicle?",
                      answer: "Charging time depends on your vehicle's battery size, the charger's power output, and your current battery level. Level 1 charging (standard outlet) can take 8-24 hours for a full charge. Level 2 charging (240V) typically takes 4-10 hours. DC Fast Charging can charge to 80% in 20-60 minutes depending on the vehicle and charger capability."

                    {
                      question: "How much does it cost to charge an EV?",
                      answer: "Charging costs vary based on electricity rates in your area and the size of your vehicle's battery. On average, charging at home costs $10-15 for a full charge (about 250-300 miles of range). Public charging stations typically charge by the kWh and rates can vary from $0.30 to $0.60 per kWh."
                    },
                    {
                      question: "Can I use any charger for my electric vehicle?",
                      answer: "Not all chargers are compatible with all EVs. Your vehicle will have a specific connector type, though adapters are available for some combinations. Tesla vehicles can use Tesla Superchargers and, with an adapter, many other stations. Non-Tesla vehicles typically use CCS, CHAdeMO, or J1772 connectors depending on the model."

                    {
                      question: "Is it better to charge at home or at public charging stations?",
                      answer: "Home charging is typically more convenient and less expensive if you have the ability to install a charger. Public charging stations are essential for longer trips and for those without home charging access. Many EV owners use a combination of both based on their needs."
                    },
                    {
                      question: "How can I find charging stations while traveling?",
                      answer: "Our app provides real-time information on charging station locations, availability, and connector types. Many EVs also have built-in navigation that can route you to compatible charging stations along your journey. Plan charging stops before your battery gets too low (below 20%) to avoid range anxiety."
